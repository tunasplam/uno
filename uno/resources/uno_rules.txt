BASIC PLAY
- You may play a card if it matches the COLOR, NUMBER, or SYMBOL of the top card on the discard pile.
- If you cannot play a valid card, you must draw a card.
- After drawing, if the drawn card is playable, you may choose to play it immediately.
- Turns proceed in order of seating unless reversed.

CARD TYPES
1. Number Cards (0–9 in four colors: Red R, Green G, Blue B, Yellow Y)
   - Playable by matching number or color.

2. Action Cards:
   - Skip (S; color-coded): Next player loses their turn.
   - Reverse (R; color-coded): Reverses direction of play.
   - Draw Two (D; color-coded): Next player draws two cards.
   - Action cards may be played by matching the card’s color or symbol.

3. Wild Cards:
   - Wild (WW): You choose the next color. Playable at any time.

Your available actions each turn are:
  "Play card"   → Attempt to play a specific card from your hand.
